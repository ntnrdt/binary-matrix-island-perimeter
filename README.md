Find perimeter of shapes formed with 1s in binary matrix

Given a matrix of N rows and M columns, consist of 0’s and 1’s. The task is to find the perimeter of subfigure consisting only 1’s in the matrix. Perimeter of single 1 is 4 as it can be covered from all 4 side. Perimeter of double 11 is 6.

Input :  mat[ ][ ] = 

        {   
            0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
            1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
            1, 0, 0, 0, 0
        }

Output : 12
